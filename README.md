Hello Coders!

My name is Jemals and I'm a bit of a science nerd. Mainly that involves numbers, logic, physics, chemistry, maths, etc... You get the picture! Anyway, aside from that I am working on developing my coding skills in various languages. I'm thinking of working in a variety of fields before and while I am at university, purely for fun. So you can guess I'm pretty keen on working out how to make stuff. I think I'll work with Python (3.4+), C++, Rust and anything else that either:

  A) Takes my fancy,
  B) I can understand,
  C) Is useful for actually developing with.
  
So why not stop on by and marvel at my inadequacy? If you're feeling generous, perhaps you could even give me a few pointers on, well, everything. But more precisely in formation of algorithms in solving ideas. Hah, I could even work with you on one of your projects as a form of experience.

Sowieso, genug quasseln!

Until then!
